Join our virtual hackathon and use your intellect and energy to make a difference. We need YOU to help solve urgent societal problems in materials and chemistry ðŸŒŸ

Prior to the hackathon, this event will require that you think of problems you might want to solve and start forming teams. 
During the hackathon, the organizers will be available to support you.
